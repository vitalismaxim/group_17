## Getting Started
To directly view the outcomes of our simulations, you can refer to the `OFC_final.ipynb` notebook. The process of constructing the OFC model is located in the directory `others`, and you can find additional results and comparisons of our simulation in the `OFC_non_homogenous.ipynb` notebook.




### Prerequisites

A `requirements.txt` file has been provided, this should install any necessary libraries!
